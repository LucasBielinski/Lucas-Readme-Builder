## Description

This is a README generator. I created this project to simplify the process of building a README. This will help developers save time when creating a README, and hopefully it will take the strain off of developers when creating a new README. 

Technologies used: Node.js and Inquirer

## Installation

You must use Node.js and Inquirer when using this project.

## Usage

Simply type "node index" in the terminal, you will then be presented with questions to fill out your README. You will be asked what you want in each section of your README and what kind of licenses you would like to use.


## Credits

N/A
